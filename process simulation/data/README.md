### Maximum Xe purity or recovery predicted from the Langmuir parameters based on ML models versus a. Xe/Kr IAST selectivity, b. Xe/Kr Henry selectivity, c. Xe and Kr working capacity. The mixture uptakes of Xe and Kr (20% Xe and 80% Kr) at 1 and 0.1 bar were obtained by combining the predicted single-component isotherms with the IAST. The number of data points in the figures is 6,367.

### Xe purity and recovery results of 15 Xe-selective MOFs from high-fidelity VSA process simulation and optimization. Dashed grey lines are 95 and 99% Xe recovery lines.
