#### (a) (b) (c) Comparison of the Xe purity at the process level obtained from GCMC isotherms with that obtained from ML-predicted, PV-estimated, ASA- estimated (Purity_(𝑚𝑎𝑥,𝑋𝑒,𝐺𝐶𝑀𝐶) and Purity_(𝑚𝑎𝑥,𝑋𝑒,𝑀𝐿), Purity_(𝑚𝑎𝑥,𝑋𝑒,𝑃𝑉), Purity_(𝑚𝑎𝑥,𝑋𝑒,𝐴𝑆𝐴) represent Xe maximum purity based on GCMC results and ML predicted, PV estimated, ASA  estimated parameters).
