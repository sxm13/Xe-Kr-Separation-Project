##### (a) Xe purity results at the raffinate for the promising materials and all materials by ideal VSA simulation(EXP: exp isotherms and exp heat of adsorption. ML: ML isotherms and MC heat of adsorption. MC: GCMC isotherms and MC heat of adsorption). (b) Distribution of Xe maximum purity for COFs(586), MOFs (6458) from ML predicted parameters and GCMC isotherms (1235)
