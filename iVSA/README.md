## Condition and Construction

![Condition](/Figures/diagram.JPG "iVSA")
          
### :arrow_lower_left: Discrete pressure swing:
No loss in S purity and energy due to pressure gradient both across the cycle time and across the column, which leads to two operation steps (adsorption and desorption) for a single cycle.

### :arrow_lower_left: Fast mass-transfer: 
100% purity of raffinate (weakly adsorbing component stream) due to fast mass-transfer between bulk gas phase to adsorbed phase.

### :arrow_lower_left: Isothermal operation: 
Heat generated from adsorption is neglected.
