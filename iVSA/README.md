## Condition and Construction

![Condition](/Figures/diagram.JPG "iVSA")
          
### • Discrete pressure swing:
No loss in S purity and energy due to pressure gradient both across the cycle time and across the column, which leads to two operation steps (adsorption and desorption) for a single cycle.

### • Fast mass-transfer: 
100% purity of raffinate (weakly adsorbing component stream) due to fast mass-transfer between bulk gas phase to adsorbed phase.

### • Isothermal operation: 
Heat generated from adsorption is neglected.
