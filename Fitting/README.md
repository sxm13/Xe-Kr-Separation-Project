## Langmuir model: 
$$ σ={M*K_P\over\(1+K_P)} $$              

## The relationship between these two parameters and the Henry coefficient:
$$ σ={βεe^{-βU_0}*P\over 1+{βεe^{-βU_0}*P\over M}} $$ 
### 1:
$$ K_H=βεe^{-βU_0} $$
### 2:
$$ K={βεe^{-βU_0}\over M} $$  
## so :arrow_double_down:
$$ K={K_H\over M} $$
