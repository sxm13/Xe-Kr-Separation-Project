# For physical features-estimated  method:     

## By pore volume: 
$$ M=PV*ρ_l $$                     
### PV is the Helium pore volume. ρ_l is the liquid density of adsorbate. We calculated PV by Zeo++ using He (radius=1.32 Å) (set number of MC samples per atom is 5000) as the probe molecule.
## By accessible surface area:
